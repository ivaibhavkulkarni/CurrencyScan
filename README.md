# MoneyLens (iOS App) |Swift, SwiftUI, Core ML, Vision, AVFoundation, Core Data, SQLite
## Developed an iOS application that detects currency notes using machine learning, announces the detected currency
via text-to-speech, and provides offline currency conversion.
- Currency Detection: Integrated Core ML and Vision frameworks for real-time currency recognition using a trained
model.
- Camera Integration: Used AVFoundation to process live camera feeds for instant currency identification.
- Text-to-Speech Announcements: Implemented AVSpeechSynthesizer to audibly announce the detected currency
for accessibility.
- Offline Currency Conversion: Designed a local database using Core Data/SQLite to store exchange rates for
conversion without internet dependency.
- User-Friendly UI: Built an interactive SwiftUI interface with a scanner view, result display, and a conversion tool.
- Info & Repeat Features: Added an info button for app guidance and a repeat function to re-announce the last
detected currency.
- Error Handling & Performance Optimization: Ensured smooth user experience by handling detection failures and
optimizing real-time processing.
